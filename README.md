## Lessons Learned

1 - DefaultTabController
--> Used to assign tabs to the given child with specific length.

2 - NestedScrollView
--> Creates a nested scroll view.

3 - SliverToBoxAdapter
--> It creates a single box widget.

4 - SliverPersistentHeader
--> Creates a sliver that varies its size when it is scrolled to the start of a viewport.

5 - SliverAppBar
--> Creates a material design app bar that can be placed in a CustomScrollView. It basically provides a beautiful animation in a nested scroll view.
